# Meeshkan :heart: open source

Hello! Thanks so much for your interest in Meeshkan.

Our small company has decided to grow our business through open source. Instead of spending money on outbound marketing, we use our resources to build, maintain, and contribute to open-source projects. This allows prospective customers to audit our code, increases trust in our brand, and provides a source of new business through collaborations with those who use or support the open-source projects with which we are associated.

## Your job at Meeshkan

The role of an open-source engineer is fivefold at Meeshkan:

- Build, launch, expand, prune, maintain, and moderate the company's open-source projects.
- Grow your own open-source projects.
- Contribute to others' open-source projects to support the open-source community.
- Contribute to our internal enterprise products and other digital assets, like our [kickin' website](https://www.meeshkan.com).
- Identify potential customers and introduce them to our business-development team if and when a collab makes sense.

This interview tests several of the above-mentioned qualities.

## The OSS technical interview

For this interview, we have identified several repos that are in need of open-source love. They all have open issues, technical debt, or bottlenecks caused by maintainers leaving or other community-related issues. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make a contribution to one of them! While there is no hard list of evaluation criteria, we will be looking for several things, none of which are required but a mix of which are important.

1. What is the nature of your contribution?
  + Does it enhance an existing feature?
  + Does it add a new feature?
  + Does it resolve an issue identified by the community?
  + Does it fix technical debt that is holding back the project?
  + Does it make the project more accessible to communities that have difficulty using or benefiting from the project?
2. Is your contribution oded in the style of the parent project?
  + Does it integrate well with the rest of the codebase?
  + Does it make use of conventions and abstractions elsewhere in the codebase?
  + Is the contribution well-commented, including all commit messages and pull requests?
  + Are there tests for the contribution when appropriate?
3. Is there documentation about the contribution?
  + If the contribution is purely documentation-related, does it reference the parts of the codebase it is documented and the associated tests?
  + Is the contribution added via a PR to the official documentation?
  + Is the contribution added to the README?
  + Does the contribution break any existing APIs or features, and if so, is this communicated cleary?
4. Is the contribution effectively communicated?
  + How did you discuss the contribution with the community? What forums (e-mail, github, gitter, etc were used)?
  + Did the community accept the contribution? If it is a new feature, is it being used? If it is cleaning up technical debt, does it resolve other issues besides the originally-identified ones?

## Show me the repos!

You can of course contribute to any repo you'd like so long as the repo has a community of more than one person (meaning it can't just be your own repo with no other contributors or community).  If you are already a contributor to or maintainer of several community-based projects, this would be a natural place to start. We have identified several repos in several languages that are all in need of some love. Feel free to pick any or, if you're feeling ambitious, several!

## Evaluation

At the start, just let us know which repo(s) you'd like to contribute to. Make sure the scope is small so you can finish within a week (ie a PR of 50 or less lines is fine!). Of course, you can take less time as well - it can go really fast if you're already a regular contributor to some projects and have something in the works.  Once you've wrapped stuff up (meaning the contribution has been created, shared, discussed and perhaps accepted), please point us to the PR/issue and we'll read it over!
